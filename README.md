infectionD3
===========

Histogram of people infected based on age in D3.

First attempt at learning D3. Single HTML file containing some CSS formating, HTML, and the D3 code. 

Data is simulated ages - 1500 infected people with various ages - from two concatenated distributions.

Each bar / bin highlights with mouse over. 

Next step: 

1. Calculate % / raw number for each bar when mouse over
2. Animate histogram (?) 
3. Include breakdown of each bar by extra variables such as age and income of those infected (data to come)
